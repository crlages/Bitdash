## OpenClaw setup on new Ubuntu notebook (Dell Inspiron)
- Remote host configured via SSH: `insp@192.168.1.103`.
- OpenClaw installation finalized successfully:
  - Node upgraded to `v22.22.0` (required by OpenClaw >= 22.12).
  - OpenClaw installed at `2026.2.9`.
- Discord pairing approval completed successfully for owner account (`642538545780621352`) using pairing code `QTRE3K4D`.
- `openclaw configure` completed with Discord channel enabled and token configured by user.
- Gateway service fixed and stabilized:
  - Installed user service `openclaw-gateway.service`.
  - Root cause of crash loop: `gateway.auth.token` missing while token auth mode active.
  - Generated and set gateway auth token; restarted service.
  - `openclaw gateway probe` now returns `Reachable: yes`.
- Security hardening partially done:
  - Tightened `~/.openclaw` permissions to `700`.
  - Still pending user-confirmed hardening for Discord `groupPolicy=allowlist` + guild/channel allowlists.

## User preference/interaction note
- User asked for faster, direct progress updates during remote setup and delegated SSH adjustments directly to assistant.

## Follow-up operations (later same day)
- User exposed API and Discord bot tokens in chat/DM context; assistant instructed immediate revocation/reset and safe local rotation workflow (no secrets in chat logs).
- Discord config troubleshooting findings:
  - `channels.discord.guilds["<guild>"].allow` is invalid at guild level in this config schema.
  - Working keys include `channels.discord.groupPolicy` (top-level) and per-channel:
    - `channels.discord.guilds["962481792999366656"].channels["962481792999366659"].allow=true`
    - `channels.discord.guilds["962481792999366656"].channels["962481792999366659"].requireMention=false`
- Post-fix status: Discord channel operation restored; session token usage reset from previously saturated context.
- Network mapping requested and performed from host visibility:
  - Gateways detected: `192.168.1.1` and `192.168.0.1`.
  - Active/seen hosts included: `192.168.1.100`, `192.168.1.102`, `192.168.1.103`, `192.168.1.105 (macbook)`, `192.168.0.2`, `192.168.0.3`.
- User requested to pause iNeural/OpenClaw model migration work and continue another day.
