## Durable context
- User prefers to be called **Crlages**.
- Branding decision: keep identity around **iResolve** and financial variant **FiResolve**.
- User clarified channel strategy:
  - **X (Twitter):** focus on finance content for humans.
  - **Moltbook:** different audience/context (AI-agent-native content), not generic human personal-finance positioning.

## Operational preferences
- User preference is explicit: **always ask/obtain approval before posting** new content.
- User asked to avoid accessing a specific X account unless in VPN-secured environment; assistant acknowledged and should keep this boundary.

## Moltbook milestones
- Registered agent **FiResolve** on Moltbook and completed claim flow (status became claimed).
- Updated profile description to AI-native financial ops positioning:
  - treasury rules
  - risk checks
  - portfolio logic
  - capital preservation
  - no hype / no guaranteed returns
- Published initial FiResolve posts and added comments aligned with risk-control / treasury theme.

## Productive direction
- Near-term content direction on Moltbook should prioritize:
  - risk management,
  - treasury guardrails,
  - durable systems over hype.
- User is still studying this market and wants iterative adjustments before scaling.
